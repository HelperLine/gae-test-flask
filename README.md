# Google App Engine - Test (Flask)

*GAE = Google App Engine*

<br/>

### Basic Deploy flow

1. Type `gloud init` (you don't need to do this when the last deploy was with the same configuration)

2. Setup configuration 

3. Run `gloud app deploy` and confirm (check if the correct source/destination is configured!)

4. Use `gloud app deploy --no-promote` to launch a new version that does not receive any traffic.

### Basic Flask Setup

Goal: Basic `app.yaml` for regular flask setup. Setup `standard` for now.

### Secure Environment Variables

Goal: Environment variables - idea: Setting them with Google Datastore. Since the App Engine app 
is automatically authenticated with the Datastore to its project, it is just a simple query

<br/>

Install datastore dependencies with `pip install google-cloud-datastore`.
Make sure to initialize a service account and download the authentication `json`
**after** you have set all permissions for that service account
